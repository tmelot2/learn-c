# Learn C!

Just a buncha crappy ol C programs I'm writing as I work though "C Programming: A Modern Approach" by K.N. King.

I learned C before my professional career, like 20 years ago, & haven't used it since. It's been a while, so my code prolly sucks, but we all gotta start somewhere! Eventually I'll get better.
